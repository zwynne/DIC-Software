# DIC-Software
Software for digital image correlation (DIC) using GoPro photos.

This project is develop stand-alone Python software for DIC analysis to allow both:

i) Post-processsing of load cell data and GoPro photos for DIC analysis

ii) Real-time collection and analysis of GoPro photos and load cell data

All software is developed in Python and converted into executable files (.exe) for use by non-technical operators. The focus is on ensuring the software is accurate, lightweight and simple to use. Currently the front-end of the software is rendered using the tkinter library.
