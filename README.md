# DIC-Software
Software for digital image correlation (DIC) using GoPro/mobile phone photos.

This project is to develop stand-alone Python software for DIC analysis to allow:

i) Post-processsing of load cell data and GoPro photos for DIC analysis

ii) Real-time collection and analysis of GoPro/mobile phone photos and USB load cell data

iii) Removal of fisheye image warping using calibration images.

All software is developed in Python and converted into executable files (.exe) for use by non-technical operators. The focus is on ensuring the software is accurate, lightweight and simple to use. Currently the front-end of the software is rendered using the tkinter library.
